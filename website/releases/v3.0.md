# Version 3.0

### ðŸ”¥ Gradio 3.0 is the biggest update to the library, ever.  

## New Features:

### 1.  Blocks ðŸ§±
 
Blocks is a new, low-level API that allows you to have full control over the data flows and layout of your application. It allows you to build very complex, multi-step applications. For example, you might want to:

* Group together related demos as multiple tabs in one web app
* Change the layout of your demo instead of just having all of the inputs on the left and outputs on the right
* Have multi-step interfaces, in which the output of one model becomes the input to the next model, or have more flexible data flows in general
* Change a component's properties (for example, the choices in a Dropdown) or its visibility based on user input

Here's a simple example that creates the demo below it:

```python
import gradio as gr

def update(name):
    return f"Welcome to Gradio, {name}!"

demo = gr.Blocks()

with demo:
    gr.Markdown(
    """
    # Hello World!
    Start typing below to see the output.
    """)
    inp = gr.Textbox(placeholder="What is your name?")
    out = gr.Textbox()

    inp.change(fn=update, 
               inputs=inp, 
               outputs=out)

demo.launch()
```

### 2. Our Revamped Design ðŸŽ¨ 

We've upgraded our design across the entire library: from components, and layouts all the way to dark mode.

### 3. A New Website ðŸ’» 

We've upgraded [gradio.app](https://gradio.app) to make it cleaner, faster and easier to use. Our docs now come with components and demos embedded directly on the page. So you can quickly get up to speed with what you're looking for.

### 4. New Components: Model3D, Dataset, and More..

We've introduced a lot of new components in `3.0`, including `Model3D`, `Dataset`, `Markdown`, `Button` and `Gallery`. You can find all the components and play around with them [here](https://gradio.app/docs/#components).
