# Version 3.2

## New Features:

### 1. Improvements to Queuing ü•á 

We've implemented a brand new queuing system based on **web sockets** instead of HTTP long polling. Among other things, this allows us to manage queue sizes better on Hugging Face Spaces. There are also additional queue-related parameters you can add:

* Now supports concurrent workers (parallelization) 
```python
demo = gr.Interface(...)
demo.queue(concurrency_count=3)
demo.launch()
```
* Configure a maximum queue size 
```python
demo = gr.Interface(...)
demo.queue(max_size=100)
demo.launch()
```

* If a user closes their tab / browser, they leave the queue, which means the demo will run faster for everyone else 

### 2. Fixes to Examples

* Dataframe examples will render properly, and look much clearer in the UI: (thanks to PR #2125)

* Image and Video thumbnails are cropped to look neater and more uniform: (thanks to PR #2109)

* Other fixes in PR #2131 and #2064  make it easier to design and use Examples

### 3. Component Fixes üß±  
* Specify the width and height of an image in its style tag (thanks to PR #2133)
```python
components.Image().style(height=260, width=300)
```
* Automatic conversion of videos so they are playable in the browser (thanks to PR #2003). Gradio will check if a video's format is playable  in the browser and, if it isn't, will automatically convert it to a format that is (mp4).
* Pass in a json filepath to the Label component (thanks to PR #2083)   
* Randomize the default value of a Slider (thanks to PR #1935)

* Improvements to State in PR #2100 

### 4. Ability to Randomize Input Sliders and Reload Data whenever the Page Loads 
* In some cases, you want to be able to show a different set of input data to every user as they load the page app. For example, you might want to randomize the value of a "seed" `Slider` input. Or you might want to show a `Textbox` with the current date. We now supporting passing _functions_ as the default value in input components. When you pass in a function, it gets **re-evaluated** every time someone loads the demo, allowing you to reload / change data for different users. 

Here's an example loading the current date time into an input Textbox:

```python
import gradio as gr
import datetime

with gr.Blocks() as demo:
    gr.Textbox(datetime.datetime.now)
    
demo.launch()
```

Note that we don't evaluate the function -- `datetime.datetime.now()` -- we pass in the function itself to get this behavior -- `datetime.datetime.now`

Because randomizing the initial value of `Slider` is a common use case, we've added a `randomize` keyword argument you can use to randomize its initial value:

```python
import gradio as gr
demo = gr.Interface(lambda x:x, gr.Slider(0, 10, randomize=True), "number")
demo.launch()
```
